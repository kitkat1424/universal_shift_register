# universal_shift_register

This repository contains the implementation of a Universal 4-bit Shift Register using Verilog. The design is implemented using both structural and behavioral modeling techniques.

Overview
A Universal Shift Register is a versatile digital circuit capable of performing multiple operations like parallel load, left shift, right shift, and holding data. This project showcases two different modeling approaches to achieve the same functionality:

Structural Modeling: This approach uses basic building blocks (such as multiplexers and flip-flops) to construct the shift register from the ground up, mimicking how the hardware would be built in a physical circuit.

Behavioral Modeling: This approach uses high-level Verilog constructs to describe the functionality of the shift register directly, making the code more abstract and easier to understand.
